Course Overview
================

Read this page for details on how this course works, what you must do to pass the course, how to submit your work, and how to get help.


Your Work
    * **Read:** Each chapter in the book contains a handful of pages you should read. The readings are interspersed with interactive components such as active code examples with which you can tinker and explore, and multiple-choice questions so you can self-check your understanding.
    * **Attempt Exercises:** At the end of each chapter is a page containing a handful of exercises for you to practice. Some are easy, others are hard. You will probably spend the majority of your time working on these exercises. You do not have to complete them all, but you must attempt at least 5 for each chapter. You are encouraged to to more, and to try to get them correct, but the minimum is that you attempt at least 5.

Pacing
    * Try to do around 2 chapters per week, spending 15 - 20 total hours.

Requirements
------------

This course is Pass/Fail. In order to pass, you must complete all the work outlined in the Evaluation criteria below.

Evaluation
    In order to pass the course, you will be evaluated on three different criteria:

    * Participation
    * Graded Exercises
    * Final Problem Set

Participation
    Participation simply means that you read all the chapters and attempt 5 or more exercises for each chapter.

Graded Exercises
    As mentioned, each chapter contains a page with exercises that you should work on. Usually, one of those exercises will be specially marked as "GRADED", meaning that you must submit your code (and it must actually work, performing correctly under a set of automated tests). See below for more details on submitting assignments.

Final Problem Set
    Towards the end of class, you will complete and turn in a larger programming assignment, which will also be graded by automated tests.


Submitting Assignments
----------------------

We will be using Vocareum for homework submission. On Vocareum, you will see a list of Assignments with names like *Chapter 3 Assignment*. When you click on the assignment you will see more detailed instructions.


Getting help
------------

We use a discussion board forum called Piazza, which you can use to ask questions.
