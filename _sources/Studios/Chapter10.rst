Studio: Bubble Sort
===================

One rite-of-passage in your programming life is to learn a bunch of canonical "sorting" algorithms: procedures for taking a jumbled list of numbers (or anything "sortable"), and putting all the numbers in order.

The simplest such algorithm is called Bubble Sort.

            The Algorithm
            -------------
            
            The main idea of Bubble Sort is to swap any two successive elements in a list if they are not in order.
            
            For example, the list ``[2, 1]`` would be sorted by swapping the ``1`` and ``2`` yielding ``[1, 2]``.
            
            For a larger list, the swapping is done from front to back with each sequential pair.
            
            Let's sort the list ``[3, 5, 2]``:
            
            - We first take the ``3, 5`` pair and compare them. Since ``3 < 5``, we don't do anything.
            - Our list is still ``[3, 5, 2]``.
            - The next pair is ``5, 2``. Since ``5 > 2`` we swap them in the list.
            - Our list is now ``[3, 2, 5]``.
            - Starting from the beginning again, we have the pair ``3, 2``, thus we swap again.
            - Our list is now ``[2, 3, 5]``.
            - At this point, the list is fully sorted, but we don't know that until we actually check.
            - So we start from the beginning yet again, but this time, we iterate over the entire list without ever having to perform any swaps. This is how we know the list is fully sorted.
            - Done!
            
            
            The pseudo code for the algorithm is as follows:
            
            ::
            
                function bubbleSort (list)
                    is_sorted = False
                    while is_sorted is False
                        nswaps = 0 ## Number of swaps made
                        for each pair, a b,  of sequential numbers in list
                            if a is greater than b
                                swap a and b
                                nswaps = nswaps + 1
                        if nswaps is still 0, then set is_sorted to True
                    return list
            
            
            Your job is to turn that pseudocode into real code!



           Write a function that will return the number of digits in an integer.

            This studio it is a good example of nested loops, indexing lists, and swapping items in lists. If you
            did not reach the solution in class, look through this one and make sure you understand it. Try and
            predict what will will happen when you alter the following things, then test it out to see if you're right!

            1. Change len(lst) - 1 to len(lst) in the range on line 9
            2. Change the greater than sign to a less than sign (line 12)
            3. Tricky one: Remove the while loop completely (line 7)
