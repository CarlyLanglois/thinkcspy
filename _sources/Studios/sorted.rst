Sorted
======

Studios are in-class activities to give you hands-on practice with new concepts. Each begins with a Walkthrough -- an instructor-led programming problem. For the Studio portion itself, you should work individually or in pairs in class.

These problems are not graded, and you are not obligated to finish them. Get as far as you can while in class, and use them as an opportunity to play with and solidify new concepts.

Studio
------

Since a string is just a sequence of characters, they can be sorted from least to greatest. Sorting can be hard so we're just going to check if a string is sorted. Write a function which returns a boolean indicating if the string is sorted or not.

Here's an example of how your function should behave.

.. sourcecode:: python

    is_sorted("ABC") == True
    is_sorted("aBc") == False
    is_sorted("dog") == False

.. activecode:: sorted_studio

    def is_sorted(string):
        """Returns True if string is sorted from least to greatest
           False otherwise.
        """
        # TODO: Fill in details
        return False
